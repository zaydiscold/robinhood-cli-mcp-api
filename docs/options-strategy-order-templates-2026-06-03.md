# Multi-leg options — hard order-body templates (2026-06-03)

The exact `POST https://api.robinhood.com/options/orders/` body per strategy, so a weak agent can
copy the leg structure and never botch `side` / `position_effect` / `ratio_quantity` / `direction`.
Resolve every `option_instrument_id` via `options enumerate <SYM> --expiration <DATE> [--type call|put]`
FIRST (UUIDs are random v4 — enumerate, never guess). Account goes in `account` (and pass `?account_number=`
on any web/preview call). Preview without placing via `POST bonfire/options/orders/review` (+
`/marketability/`) using the same `legs` shape.

## Envelope (every order)
```json
{
  "account": "https://api.robinhood.com/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/",
  "direction": "debit | credit",
  "legs": [ { "option": "https://api.robinhood.com/options/instruments/{OPTION_ID}/",
              "position_effect": "open | close", "ratio_quantity": 1, "side": "buy | sell" } ],
  "type": "limit", "time_in_force": "gfd | gtc", "trigger": "immediate",
  "price": "<net debit/credit per share, on-tick>", "quantity": "<# of spreads>", "ref_id": "<uuid>"
}
```
`price` = net debit (you pay) or net credit (you receive) **per share** — obey the chain's `min_ticks`.
`quantity` = number of spread units (not legs). For GTC opens, mind **overnight** buying power.

## Per-strategy leg tables (direction + each leg: side / position_effect / ratio)
| Strategy | direction | legs (role → side/effect/ratio) |
|---|---|---|
| **Long call / long put** | debit | the call(or put) → buy/open/1 |
| **Sell-to-close** (exit a long) | credit | the held option → sell/close/1 |
| **Covered call (CC)** | credit | OTM call → sell/open/1  *(needs 100 sh same account)* |
| **Cash-secured put (CSP)** | credit | OTM put → sell/open/1  *(needs cash collateral)* |
| **Call debit spread** | debit | lower call → buy/open/1 ; higher call → sell/open/1 |
| **Call credit spread** | credit | lower call → sell/open/1 ; higher call → buy/open/1 |
| **Put credit spread** | credit | higher put → sell/open/1 ; lower put → buy/open/1 |
| **Put debit spread** | debit | higher put → buy/open/1 ; lower put → sell/open/1 |
| **Long straddle** | debit | ATM call → buy/open/1 ; ATM put → buy/open/1 (same strike) |
| **Long strangle** | debit | OTM call → buy/open/1 ; OTM put → buy/open/1 (diff strikes) |
| **Iron condor** | credit | short put → sell/open/1 ; long put wing (lower) → buy/open/1 ; short call → sell/open/1 ; long call wing (higher) → buy/open/1 |
| **Call butterfly** | debit | low call → buy/open/1 ; mid call → sell/open/**2** ; high call → buy/open/1 |
| **Calendar (call)** | debit | near-exp call → sell/open/1 ; far-exp call → buy/open/1 (same strike, two expirations) |

## Closing a multi-leg (roll / exit)
Same legs with `position_effect: "close"` and the sides **inverted** (buy↔sell). A **roll** = a close
order + a fresh open order; cash accounts must stage the open to the next business day (T+1 settled
cash) — use `options roll-plan --cash-account`.

## Build it with the tooling (don't hand-assemble)
- `options enumerate <SYM> --expiration <DATE>` → every strike's `option_instrument_id`.
- `options strategy-quote <id> --account <N> --symbol <S> --expiration <D> --leg <role>=<strike> …`
  resolves the legs, reads bid/ask/Greeks, computes a net price, and emits the dry-run body — preferred
  over copying these tables by hand. The tables exist so the leg topology is unambiguous.
- Preview server-side (no placement): `POST bonfire/options/orders/review` with the `legs` array above
  (note: that bonfire preview is cookie/CSRF-gated; the place endpoint `api.robinhood.com/options/orders/`
  works with the bearer token).

## Explicit leg construction — expiry, strike distance, side, and how to route/enumerate each leg
- **Expiration per leg:** all legs share ONE expiration **except** the **calendar/diagonal**, where the
  near leg and far leg are DIFFERENT expirations (sell near, buy far). Enumerate each separately:
  `options enumerate <SYM> --expiration <NEAR>` and `... --expiration <FAR>`.
- **Strike relationships (low → high):**
  - Vertical: 2 strikes, same type+expiry; width `|K_high − K_low|` = max risk/share.
  - Iron condor: `longPutWing < shortPut < spot < shortCall < longCallWing` (wings are FURTHER OTM than the shorts).
  - Butterfly: `low < mid < high`, equally spaced; **buy 1 low, sell 2 mid (body), buy 1 high**.
  - Straddle: same ATM strike (call+put). Strangle: `putStrike < spot < callStrike` (both OTM).
- **Which side / effect each leg:** `buy` = long/adds debit; `sell` = short/collects credit;
  `position_effect:open` to enter, `close` to exit (a roll = close legs + open legs; sides invert on close).
- **Routing to get each leg's UUID:** `options enumerate <SYM> --expiration <DATE> --type call|put` →
  every strike→`option_instrument_id` for that side. **Call legs come from `--type call`, put legs from
  `--type put`** — never reuse a UUID across type or expiration (distinct contracts). Match your chosen
  strike to its id, drop it into the leg's `option`/`option_id`.

## Live-validated 2026-06-03 (place→verify→cancel via `options/orders/`, market closed, all cancelled)
Placed `201` + cancelled (leg structure RH-accepted): long call, long put, call/put debit spreads,
straddle, strangle, butterfly (ratio 2), calendar (two expirations). Credit spreads + iron condor
parsed structurally, then hit the account's **overnight buying-power** gate (legs valid — needs
collateral); the standalone covered-call leg correctly rejected **"infinite risk"** (naked short without
the 100 backing shares). Conclusion: **all leg topologies are RH-verified**; credit/short strategies
additionally require coverage/BP. Reproduce with `scripts/validate-strategies.mjs <SYM> <ACCOUNT>`.
